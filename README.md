# WineDataAnalysis
# Wine Classification

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook (`wine_classification.ipynb`) using Python libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a classifier that can predict the type of wine given a set of input features. The dataset used is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains measurements for three classes of wine.

### Features

- 13 numerical features related to the chemical composition of wines.
- Target variable: Wine class (0, 1, 2).

### Tasks Covered

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Cross-validation
- Confusion matrix and performance metrics visualization

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (optional, for running in notebook interface)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
